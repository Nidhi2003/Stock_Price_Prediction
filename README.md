# Stock_Price_Prediction
Stock Price Prediction is the task of forecasting future stock prices based on historical data and various market indicators.
It involves using statistical models and machine learning algorithms to analyze financial data and make predictions
about the future performance of a stock. The goal of stock price prediction is to help investors make informed investment
decisions by providing a forecast of future stock prices.

More people invest their money in the stock market.
However, this kind of investment possesses a lot of risks. 
Therefore, many works have been done to build a model using Machine Learning algorithm to try to predict the stock price values.
In this work, Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) techniques are used to predict the 
closing price from five different companies.
The models are evaluated using one of the common error metrics, which is RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
The results of the experiment indicate that LSTM has better performance than SVR.
